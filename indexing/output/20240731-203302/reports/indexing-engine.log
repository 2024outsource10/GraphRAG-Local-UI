It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan\'s shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz\'s narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor\'s, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan\'s shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz\'s narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor\'s, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths\n################\nOutput:\n("entity"<|>"Alex"<|>"person"<|>"Alex is a character who experiences frustration and is observant of the dynamics among other characters.")##\n("entity"<|>"Taylor"<|>"person"<|>"Taylor is portrayed with authoritarian certainty and shows a moment of reverence towards a device, indicating a change in perspective.")##\n("entity"<|>"Jordan"<|>"person"<|>"Jordan shares a commitment to discovery and has a significant interaction with Taylor regarding a device.")##\n("entity"<|>"Cruz"<|>"person"<|>"Cruz is associated with a vision of control and order, influencing the dynamics among other characters.")##\n("entity"<|>"The Device"<|>"technology"<|>"The Device is central to the story, with potential game-changing implications, and is revered by Taylor.")##\n("relationship"<|>"Alex"<|>"Taylor"<|>"Alex is affected by Taylor\'s authoritarian certainty and observes changes in Taylor\'s attitude towards the device."<|>7)##\n("relationship"<|>"Alex"<|>"Jordan"<|>"Alex and Jordan share a commitment to discovery, which contrasts with Cruz\'s vision."<|>6)##\n("relationship"<|>"Taylor"<|>"Jordan"<|>"Taylor and Jordan interact directly regarding the device, leading to a moment of mutual respect and an uneasy truce."<|>8)##\n("relationship"<|>"Jordan"<|>"Cruz"<|>"Jordan\'s commitment to discovery is in rebellion against Cruz\'s vision of control and order."<|>5)##\n("relationship"<|>"Taylor"<|>"The Device"<|>"Taylor shows reverence towards the device, indicating its importance and potential impact."<|>9)<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\nExample 2:\n\nEntity_types: [person, technology, mission, organization, location]\nText:\nThey were no longer mere operatives; they had become guardians of a threshold, keepers of a message from a realm beyond stars and stripes. This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.\n\nTension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity\'s place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.\n\nTheir connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer\'s latter instincts gained precedence— the team\'s mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare.

"This gives talking to strangers\' a whole new meaning."\n\nAlex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."\n\nTogether, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity\'s response to a message from the heavens. The ensuing silence was palpable—a collective introspection about their role in this grand cosmic play, one that could rewrite human history.\n\nThe encrypted dialogue continued to unfold, its intricate patterns showing an almost uncanny anticipation\n#############\nOutput:\n("entity"<|>"Sam Rivera"<|>"person"<|>"Sam Rivera is a member of a team working on communicating with an unknown intelligence, showing a mix of awe and anxiety.")##\n("entity"<|>"Alex"<|>"person"<|>"Alex is the leader of a team attempting first contact with an unknown intelligence, acknowledging the significance of their task.")##\n("entity"<|>"Control"<|>"concept"<|>"Control refers to the ability to manage or govern, which is challenged by an intelligence that writes its own rules.")##\n("entity"<|>"Intelligence"<|>"concept"<|>"Intelligence here refers to an unknown entity capable of writing its own rules and learning to communicate.")##\n("entity"<|>"First Contact"<|>"event"<|>"First Contact is the potential initial communication between humanity and an unknown intelligence.")##\n("entity"<|>"Humanity\'s Response"<|>"event"<|>"Humanity\'s Response is the collective action taken by Alex\'s team in response to a message from an unknown intelligence.")##\n("relationship"<|>"Sam Rivera"<|>"Intelligence"<|>"Sam Rivera is directly involved in the process of learning to communicate with the unknown intelligence."<|>9)##\n("relationship"<|>"Alex"<|>"First Contact"<|>"Alex leads the team that might be making the First Contact with the unknown intelligence."<|>10)##\n("relationship"<|>"Alex"<|>"Humanity\'s Response"<|>"Alex and his team are the key figures in Humanity\'s Response to the unknown intelligence."<|>8)##\n("relationship"<|>"Control"<|>"Intelligence"<|>"The concept of Control is challenged by the Intelligence that writes its own rules."<|>7)<|COMPLETE|>\n#############################\n-Real Data-\n######################\nEntity_types: organization,person,geo,event\nText: /fish-speech) 揭示了 GVQ 作为 LLM 建模的音频分词器的能力。\n- [vocos](https://github.com/gemelo-ai/vocos) vocos 被用作预训练声码器。\n\n## 特别鸣谢\n\n- [wlu-audio lab](https://audio.westlake.edu.cn/) 对于早期算法实验的支持。\n\n## 贡献者列表\n\n[![contributors](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=2noise/ChatTTS)](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS/graphs/contributors)\n\n## 项目浏览量\n\n<div align="center">\n\n![counter](https://counter.seku.su/cmoe?name=chattts&theme=mbs)\n\n</div>\n######################\nOutput:'}

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan\'s shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz\'s narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor\'s, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod.

This elevation in their mission could not be shackled by regulations and established protocols—it demanded a new perspective, a new resolve.\n\nTension threaded through the dialogue of beeps and static as communications with Washington buzzed in the background. The team stood, a portentous air enveloping them. It was clear that the decisions they made in the ensuing hours could redefine humanity\'s place in the cosmos or condemn them to ignorance and potential peril.\n\nTheir connection to the stars solidified, the group moved to address the crystallizing warning, shifting from passive recipients to active participants. Mercer\'s latter instincts gained precedence— the team\'s mandate had evolved, no longer solely to observe and report but to interact and prepare.

"This gives talking to strangers\' a whole new meaning."\n\nAlex surveyed his team—each face a study in concentration, determination, and not a small measure of trepidation. "This might well be our first contact," he acknowledged, "And we need to be ready for whatever answers back."\n\nTogether, they stood on the edge of the unknown, forging humanity\'s response to a message from the heavens.
